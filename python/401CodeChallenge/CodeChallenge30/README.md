# Challenge Title
Code Challenge: Class 30

## Whiteboard Process
Coming soon, will be adding docstrings to working code to properly explain each step.

## Approach & Efficiency
Time: O(1) Since we can look up our exact location where our value is stored.
Space: O(n) This is because we don't always know the information we are looking for.

## Solution
run pytest
python/tests/data_structures/test_hashtable.py
